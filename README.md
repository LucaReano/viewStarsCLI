# starViewCLI

## Description

*"When you see the stars you are looking into the past. Because light takes time to travel and stars are many light years away from us you could be seeing a star that doesnâ€™t even exist anymore."* :star2:

starViewCLI is a simple line application that provide information about stars visibility in a moment that you decide. You can also create an astronomical diary (a blank file with a title and current datetime) where write all of your notes and read them.

It was created to determine the best stars observing time. In fact, stars are more visible if:
- is night (of course), 
- weather is clear and cloudiness is low, 
- Moon is not full or better is a new Moon :new_moon:
- there's no light pollution (or is little at least).
